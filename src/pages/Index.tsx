      faqItems: [
        { question: "Is a higher polling rate always better?", answer: "Not necessarily. While a higher polling rate can reduce input lag and improve responsiveness, it also requires more CPU resources. Most gamers find that 1000Hz offers a good balance. For casual use, 125-500Hz is typically sufficient." },
        { question: "My polling rate seems low, what can I do?", answer: "Ensure your mouse drivers are up-to-date. Check your mouse software for polling rate settings. Some mice allow adjustments via onboard buttons. Close unnecessary background applications that might be consuming CPU resources. Try a different USB port." },
        { question: "Why does polling rate matter for gaming?", answer: "In competitive gaming, especially fast-paced shooters and esports titles, every millisecond counts. A higher polling rate means more frequent position updates, resulting in smoother tracking and reduced input lag. This can give players a slight edge in scenarios where precise, quick movements are crucial." },
        { question: "How accurate is this test?", answer: "This test provides a good approximation of your mouse's polling rate, but browser-based tests have limitations. Factors like CPU load, browser performance, and system resources can affect the results. For the most accurate testing, try running the test when your system isn't under heavy load." }
