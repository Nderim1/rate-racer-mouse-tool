# DPI vs. eDPI: The Ultimate Guide to Mouse Sensitivity

"What DPI do you play on?" is a common question in gaming communities. But the answer—"800"—doesn't tell the whole story.

If Player A uses 800 DPI with an in-game sensitivity of 1.0, and Player B uses 800 DPI with an in-game sensitivity of 2.0, Player B's mouse is effectively *twice as fast*.

To compare sensitivity accurately across different players and setups, we need a better metric. Enter **eDPI (Effective Dots Per Inch)**.

## What is DPI?

**DPI (Dots Per Inch)** refers to the hardware sensitivity of your mouse sensor. It measures how many "counts" or pixels the cursor moves for every inch you physically move the mouse.

*   **Low DPI (400-800)**: Requires larger physical movements. Preferred by many CS:GO/Valorant pros for precision.
*   **High DPI (1600-3200+)**: Requires smaller movements. Can feel "jittery" if you don't have steady hands.

You can check your current DPI using our **[DPI Analyzer](/mouse-tools/dpi-analyzer)** to see if your mouse is actually performing at its stated setting.

## What is eDPI?

**eDPI (Effective Dots Per Inch)** is the *true* sensitivity output. It combines your hardware DPI with your software (in-game) sensitivity.

### The Formula
$$ \text{eDPI} = \text{DPI} \times \text{In-Game Sensitivity} $$

### Example
*   **Player A**: 800 DPI × 1.5 Sensitivity = **1200 eDPI**
*   **Player B**: 400 DPI × 3.0 Sensitivity = **1200 eDPI**

Even though their settings look different, Player A and Player B have the **exact same effective sensitivity**. They will both turn the same amount of degrees for the same physical mouse movement.

## Why Use eDPI?

1.  **Universal Comparison**: It allows you to compare your sensitivity directly with pro players, regardless of what DPI they use.
2.  **Hardware Swapping**: If you buy a new mouse that defaults to a different DPI, you can adjust your in-game sensitivity to match your old eDPI, keeping your muscle memory intact.
3.  **Finding Your Range**: Most pros in a specific game fall within a certain eDPI range. Knowing this helps you avoid using a sensitivity that is objectively "too high" or "too low" for that game.

## Common eDPI Ranges (Approximate)

*   **Tactical Shooters (CS:GO, Valorant)**:
    *   Low eDPI is king here. Precision matters more than speed.
    *   *Typical Range*: 200 - 400 eDPI (assuming Valorant scale) or 600 - 1200 eDPI (CS:GO scale).
*   **Arena Shooters (Overwatch, Apex Legends)**:
    *   Requires more tracking and 180-degree turns.
    *   *Typical Range*: Higher eDPI is common to allow for faster movement.

## How to Find Your Perfect Sensitivity

There is no "magic number," but there is a method to find what works for you:

1.  **The "PSA Method"**:
    *   Set your sensitivity so that one full swipe of your mouse pad turns your character 360 degrees.
    *   Try playing. If you overshoot targets, lower it. If you undershoot, raise it.
2.  **Stick with it**: Muscle memory takes time to build. Don't change your sensitivity every day.
3.  **Check your Hardware**: Sometimes, inconsistent aim isn't your fault. Use our **[DPI Analyzer](/mouse-tools/dpi-analyzer)** to ensure your mouse sensor isn't deviating wildly from its stated DPI.

## Summary

*   **DPI**: Hardware setting (Mouse).
*   **Sensitivity**: Software setting (Game).
*   **eDPI**: The combination of both ($DPI \times Sensitivity$).
*   Use **eDPI** to compare settings with others.
*   Use the **[DPI Analyzer](/mouse-tools/dpi-analyzer)** to verify your hardware accuracy.

Stop guessing your settings. Calculate your eDPI, find your comfort zone, and start hitting those shots!
