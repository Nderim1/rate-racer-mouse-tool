# What is NKRO? Understanding Key Rollover for Mechanical Keyboards

You're in the middle of a heated game. You're sprinting (Shift), moving forward (W), strafing left (A), and trying to jump (Space) while reloading (R). Suddenly, your character stops moving, or the jump doesn't register.

Your keyboard just "jammed."

This phenomenon is caused by a lack of **Key Rollover**. In this guide, we'll explain what NKRO is, why cheap keyboards fail this test, and how to check if your keyboard is gaming-ready.

## What is Key Rollover (KRO)?

**Key Rollover** refers to the number of keys your keyboard can correctly register when pressed simultaneously.

### 2KRO (2-Key Rollover)
Common in very old or cheap membrane keyboards. It can only guarantee that **2 keys** pressed at once will work. If you press a 3rd key, it might be ignored. This is terrible for gaming.

### 6KRO (6-Key Rollover)
The standard for most USB keyboards for a long time. It can register up to **6 keys** plus modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift) simultaneously.
*   **Is 6KRO enough?** For 99% of gamers, yes. It's rare to press more than 6 keys at the exact same moment with just two hands.

### NKRO (N-Key Rollover)
The gold standard. "N" stands for "Unlimited." With an NKRO keyboard, you could mash your face onto the keyboard, press all 104 keys at once, and the computer would see every single one of them.

## Ghosting vs. Jamming

People often confuse these terms:

*   **Jamming**: You press a key, and nothing happens. The keyboard "blocks" the input because it can't handle the combination.
*   **Ghosting**: You press two keys, and a *third* key that you didn't touch is registered. This is a "ghost" press.

Modern gaming keyboards are designed to be "Anti-Ghosting," meaning they prevent false key presses, even if they can't register unlimited keys.

## Why Do You Need NKRO?

1.  **Complex Key Binds**: In MMORPGs or flight simulators, you might hold multiple modifiers (Ctrl+Shift+Alt) while pressing other keys.
2.  **Rhythm Games**: Games like *osu!* or *StepMania* often require pressing 4-7 keys rapidly or simultaneously.
3.  **Local Multiplayer**: If two people are playing a fighting game on the same keyboard (Player 1 on WASD, Player 2 on Arrows), a non-NKRO keyboard will almost certainly jam.
4.  **Peace of Mind**: You never want to die in-game because your hardware decided to ignore your input.

## How to Test Your Keyboard

You can test your keyboard's rollover capabilities right now with our **[Key Rollover Test](/keyboard-tools/key-rollover)**.

### The Test:
1.  **Open the Tool**: Go to the [Key Rollover Test](/keyboard-tools/key-rollover) page.
2.  **Press Keys**: Start holding down keys one by one. Don't let go.
3.  **Count**: See how many light up on the screen before new ones stop registering.
    *   If you can hold **WASD + Space + Shift** and they all light up, you're good for FPS games.
    *   If you can press both palms down and see 20+ keys light up, you have NKRO.

## Summary

*   **Rollover**: How many keys you can press at once.
*   **6KRO**: Registers 6 keys. Good enough for most.
*   **NKRO**: Registers ALL keys. The best for gaming.
*   **Ghosting**: False key presses (bad).
*   **Jamming**: Missed key presses (bad).

Don't let a cheap office keyboard ruin your killstreak. Test your rollover and upgrade to a mechanical keyboard with NKRO if you want the best performance.
