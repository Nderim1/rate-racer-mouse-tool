# How to Improve Your CPS (Clicks Per Second) in Minecraft and FPS Games

In the heat of a Minecraft PvP battle or an intense shooter standoff, speed is everything. While aim and strategy are crucial, raw clicking speed—measured in **CPS (Clicks Per Second)**—can often be the deciding factor in a close fight.

High CPS allows you to take less knockback in Minecraft, build bridges faster, and unleash a flurry of attacks that overwhelm your opponent. But how do the pros hit 15, 20, or even higher CPS?

This guide covers the most popular clicking techniques, how to practice them, and how to measure your progress.

## Why CPS Matters

**CPS** stands for **Clicks Per Second**. It's a simple metric: how many times can you click your mouse button in one second?

*   **Standard Clicking**: Most people click at 6-7 CPS normally.
*   **Competitive PvP**: Good players often aim for 10-12 CPS.
*   **Elite/Godbridge**: Advanced techniques can push this to 20+ CPS.

**Benefits of High CPS:**
1.  **Reduced Knockback (Minecraft)**: In Minecraft version 1.8.9 (the standard for PvP), clicking faster actually reduces the knockback you take from enemy hits. This makes it easier to hold your ground and start a combo.
2.  **Faster Building**: Techniques like "Godbridging" or "Breezily bridging" require precise, high-speed clicking to place blocks under your feet while sprinting.
3.  **Higher DPS**: In games with semi-automatic weapons, clicking faster means firing faster (up to the weapon's fire rate cap).

## Popular Clicking Techniques

### 1. Jitter Clicking (10-14 CPS)
**Technique**: Instead of using your finger muscles to click, you vibrate your entire forearm muscles. This vibration travels down to your finger, causing it to "jitter" rapidly on the mouse button.
*   **Pros**: Consistent, high speed.
*   **Cons**: Can be tiring; harder to aim while your hand is vibrating.
*   **Risk**: Can cause strain if done incorrectly. Take breaks!

### 2. Butterfly Clicking (15-25 CPS)
**Technique**: You use two fingers (usually index and middle) on the *same* mouse button, alternating them rapidly.
*   **Pros**: Very high CPS; less tiring than jitter clicking.
*   **Cons**: Requires a mouse with wide buttons; some servers ban it if it triggers "double click" checks.
*   **Note**: Works best on mice that allow "double clicking" (where one physical tap registers as two clicks due to switch bounce).

### 3. Drag Clicking (20-30+ CPS)
**Technique**: You drag your finger across the mouse button surface. The friction causes your finger to skip or "stutter" across the surface, triggering the switch dozens of times in a single swipe.
*   **Pros**: Insane CPS bursts.
*   **Cons**: Only useful for short bursts (like placing a bridge extension); very difficult to aim and click simultaneously.
*   **Requirement**: Needs a mouse with a specific surface texture (matte/grippy) and switches.

## How to Practice and Improve

Improving your CPS isn't just about knowing the technique; it's about building muscle memory and stamina.

### 1. Use a Click Speed Test
You can't improve what you don't measure. Use our **[Click Speed Test](/mouse-tools/click-speed)** to establish your baseline.
*   Try a **1-second test** for burst speed.
*   Try a **5-second test** for PvP stamina.
*   Try a **10-second test** for endurance.

### 2. Practice Aiming While Clicking
Clicking fast is useless if you're looking at the sky.
*   Start with normal clicking and track a moving target.
*   Switch to jitter clicking and try to keep your crosshair steady on a stationary target.
*   Gradually add movement.

### 3. Optimize Your Hardware
*   **Mouse Switches**: Mechanical switches (like Omron) are often preferred for butterfly/drag clicking because they can "double click." Optical switches (like in newer Razer mice) prevent double clicking, which is good for durability but "bad" for artificially inflating CPS.
*   **Grip Tape**: Adding grip tape to your mouse buttons can help with drag clicking friction.

## A Warning on Health

**Safety First**: Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome are real risks for gamers.
*   **Don't push through pain**. If your hand, wrist, or forearm hurts, STOP.
*   **Stretch**: Perform hand and wrist stretches before and after gaming sessions.
*   **Relax**: Tension kills speed. Try to keep your hand as relaxed as possible while clicking.

## Summary

*   **CPS** is a vital skill for Minecraft PvP and some shooters.
*   **Jitter Clicking** uses arm vibration for speed (10-14 CPS).
*   **Butterfly Clicking** uses two fingers for maximum efficiency (15-20+ CPS).
*   **Practice safely**: Use our [Click Speed Test](/mouse-tools/click-speed) to track progress, but listen to your body to avoid injury.
