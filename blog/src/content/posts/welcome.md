# Welcome to TestMyRig Blog

We're excited to launch the TestMyRig blog, your go-to resource for everything related to gaming peripheral testing and optimization.

## Why Test Your Peripherals?

In competitive gaming and professional work, every millisecond counts. Your mouse, keyboard, and monitor are the primary interfaces between you and your digital environment. Understanding their true performance characteristics can help you:

- **Identify bottlenecks** in your setup
- **Optimize settings** for better responsiveness
- **Make informed decisions** when upgrading hardware
- **Troubleshoot issues** before they affect your performance

## What We Offer

TestMyRig provides a comprehensive suite of testing tools:

### Mouse Testing
- **Polling Rate Test**: Measure your mouse's actual polling rate
- **Click Latency Test**: Determine input lag from click to registration
- **Accuracy Tests**: Evaluate tracking precision and consistency

### Keyboard Testing
- **Key Response Time**: Measure mechanical switch actuation speed
- **Typing Speed Test**: Benchmark your WPM and accuracy
- **N-Key Rollover Test**: Verify simultaneous key press detection

### Monitor Testing
- **Refresh Rate Verification**: Confirm your display is running at the advertised refresh rate
- **Input Lag Test**: Measure total system latency
- **Pixel Response Time**: Test for ghosting and motion blur

## The Science Behind the Tests

Our testing methodology is built on precision timing APIs and statistical analysis. We use high-resolution timestamps to capture events at the microsecond level, ensuring accurate measurements even for high-performance gaming peripherals.

For mouse polling rate, we sample movement events over a period of time and calculate the frequency distribution. This gives you not just an average, but a complete picture of your mouse's performance consistency.

## Getting Started

Ready to test your setup? Head over to our [testing suite](/) and select the tool that matches your needs. Each test includes detailed instructions and explanations of the metrics.

## Stay Tuned

We'll be publishing regular content on:
- Hardware reviews and comparisons
- Optimization guides
- Industry news and trends
- Technical deep-dives into peripheral technology
